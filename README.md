# Image Recognition using PyTorch

## Overview

This project focuses on image recognition using PyTorch, a deep learning library in Python. The Jupyter Notebook included in this project demonstrates how to create a simple image recognition model, train it on a dataset, and make predictions. The goal is to provide a foundational example for those interested in computer vision and deep learning using PyTorch.

## Project Structure

- `image_recognition_pytorch.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for image recognition model creation, training, and predictions.
- `dataset/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training the image recognition model.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `torch`: PyTorch library for deep learning.
- `torchvision`: PyTorch's computer vision library.
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization library.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

## Running the Project
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook image_recognition_pytorch.ipynb in a Jupyter environment.
Make sure to have the dataset available in the dataset/ directory.
Follow the notebook steps for model creation, training, and making predictions.

## Image Recognition Model
The project showcases creating a simple image recognition model using PyTorch.
The model is trained on a dataset, and predictions are made on sample images.

## Customization
Replace the provided dataset with your own dataset for specific image recognition tasks.
Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies for improved accuracy.
